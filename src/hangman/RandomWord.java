 * â€œYou have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines, 
 * merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be your surprise, 
 * my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune? 
 * Absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent son? I wish to prepare you for the woeful
 *  news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.
